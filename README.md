# SMA SpeedWire Integration for Home Assistant  

Custom integration for Home Assistant to connect SMA inverters via SpeedWire protocol. The integration polls every 5 minutes only 3 entities because i only needed it for my Energy Dashboard:
- Energy production total in kWh
- Energy production today in kWh
- Power production now in kW

I will start working on some more...

The integration should support a range of SMA Inverters here a [list](https://github.com/eddso/ha_sma_speedwire/blob/39602431658489f4351875d33fa17b9595e79a82/custom_components/sma_speedwire/sma_speedwire.py#L27).  

## Installation
### a) Install over HACS

### b) Install manual
If you don't have or don't want use HACS, install it over Terminal:
```
cd config/custom_components
wget https://github.com/eddso/ha_sma_speedwire/archive/refs/heads/main.tar.gz
tar --strip-components=3 -xzf main.tar.gz ha_sma_speedwire-main/custom_components/sma_speedwire
```
### Restart 
After install restart Home-Assistant under the  Configuration -> System -> Restart

## Setup
- After installation, you should find **SMA SpeedWire** under the Configuration -> Integrations -> Add integration.

- Enter IP and password (default password is '0000') of inverter on integration setup. Normaly the inverter get the IP over DHCP. So you should configure your router to give always the same IP to inverter.
